# Helldivers 2 Fan Wiki

## Description
The **Helldivers 2 Fan Wiki** is a small, user-friendly fan project designed to provide quick, clear, and detailed information about *Helldivers 2*. Built as part of a Front-End Web Development course, this site serves as a testing ground for applying web technologies as they are learned.

It features dynamic elements, structured content, and a clear navigation system â€” all themed around the Helldivers universe and its iconic Super Earth aesthetic.

### ðŸ–¥ Local Testing
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Run using a local development server:
   - **Recommended:** Use Live Server in VS Code.
   - Or run with Python: `python -m http.server`
3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

> **Note:** Fetching JSON (`data.json`) will not work via `file://` due to a CORS error â€” a local server is required.
